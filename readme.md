## How to run the project

- The project could normally be run accessing the URL like in the demo video, but due to Heroku hourly billing I decided to not have the app deployed the whole time. It can be deployed on request if it is needed.
- The app can also be run after downloading the repository and running:
  - npm i (installs the dependencies - needed to do in the main repository and in the "frontend" repository)
  - npm run dev (runs the server and frontend using concurrently)
  - the app is then accessible on localhost:3000
